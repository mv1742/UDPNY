## Abstract

Gentrification and displacement are pressing issues for many cities today, as urban populations continue to grow and neighborhoods change rapidly in response. While gentrification can bring new businesses, resources, and other positive changes to a neighborhood, the rapid change can be destabilizing to long-term, low-income residents already in the area. Thus, it is important to better understand the activities and behaviors in these changing areas to better provide insight for the local community and public officials. This study utilizes two such novel data sources, Twitter and Foursquare, to explore gentrification and displacement risk for neighborhoods within the 31-county NY metro region. Using methodology established by the UC Berkeley Urban Displacement Project, and expanding on last year’s CUSP capstone project, we utilize both administrative census data and user-generated social media data, to model the gentrification phenomena and in changing neighborhoods. We show that Foursquare and Twitter have the potential of improving prediction of gentrification, but their power for modelling gentrification alone is still weak compared to benefits derived from Census data. We propose alternative definitions of gentrification related to Supergentrification, people gentrification (using college education and income) and place gentrification (using housing and rent price). With these alternative, more specific definitions of change, we were able to see more impact from Foursquare and Twitter datasets on certain change types. Our results show that it is easier to model ‘people’ or ‘place’ gentrification than combining the two.
